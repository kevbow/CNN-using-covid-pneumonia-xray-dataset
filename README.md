# CNN-using-covid-pneumonia-xray-dataset
In this project, I used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify x-ray images of patients with pneumonia and healthy patients. The data consists of two label which is NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. Each image has different pixel size but to process them further I reduce the size and make them smaller with the same size.
